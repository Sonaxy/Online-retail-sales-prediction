# Online-retail-sales-prediction

In many businesses, identifying which customers will make a purchase (and when), is a critical exercise.
This is true for both brick-and-mortar outlets and online stores.
The data provided in this assignment is website traffic data acquired from an online retailer and provides
information on customerâ€™s website site visit behavior. Customers may visit the store multiple times, on
multiple days, with or without making a purchase.
The goal is to predict how much sales revenue can be expected from each customer. The variable
revenue lists the amount of money that a customer spends on a given visit. The goal is to predict how
much money a customer will spend, in total, across all visits to the website, during the allotted one-year
time frame (August 2016 to August 2017).
More speciffically, one will need to predict a transformation of the aggregrate customer-level sales value
based on the natural log.
